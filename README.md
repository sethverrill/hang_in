### Context:
[//]: This project was created over the course of a week as a Module Two assignment in my seventh and eigth weeks at Turing.

### Contributors:
[//]: I was the sole contributor to this project.

### Learning Goals:
[//]: My learning goals for this project were to write DRY JavaScript and use CSS and HTML to match styling and layout comps.

I feel good about my growth across this project. There's certainly room for improvement, but I was able to accomplish most of my stretch goals.

### Wins + Challenges:
[//]: My wins and challenges went hand in hand on this project. It was important to me to have descriptive alts for all my images. Because I added these alts to the images early, I created a lot of stumbling blocks for myself which were fun to work out solutions for.

I did a lot of things based on the MDN docs for this project which made me question if there were better ways to do the same thing. I was able to find a lot of things that weren't explicitly spelled out in the docs by researching each method more deeply.
